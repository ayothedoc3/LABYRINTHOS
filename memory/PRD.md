2. **Contract Lifecycle Management:** Visual, stage-gated system to manage contracts through defined lifecycle (Proposal, Bid, Active, Paused, Completed).
3. **CRM Modules:** Sales (leads, qualification, proposals), Affiliates (referral tracking, commissions), Communication (structured, per-contract threads).
4. **Playbook Engine:** Backend logic to translate strategic inputs into structured execution plans.
5. **Design System Enhancement:** Premium, calm, structured UI following defined design principles.
6. **Optimization Plan Feature:** Make the final step of Labyrinth Builder functional.

## Known Issues & Limitations

### Remaining Low-Priority Items
- Role dashboard hardcoded data (minor - works fine with current implementation)
- Contract lifecycle demo data (already using MongoDB)

### Now Persisted to MongoDB ✅
- **Sales CRM:** leads, proposals
- **Affiliate CRM:** affiliates, referrals, commissions
- **Communications:** threads, messages
- **External API:** deals, leads, tasks, partners
- **Playbook Engine:** execution plans

### Technical Debt
- Some components still use raw Tailwind instead of design system classes
- Send message endpoint uses query params instead of JSON body
